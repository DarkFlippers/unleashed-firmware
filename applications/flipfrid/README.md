# Flipfrid

Basic EM4100 Fuzzer

## Why

Flipfrid is a simple Rfid fuzzer using EM4100 protocol (125khz).
Objective is to provide a simple to use fuzzer to test readers by emulating various cards.

EM4100 cards use a 1 byte customer id and 4 bytes card id.

## How

There is 4 modes :
- Default key loop over 16 factory/default keys and emulate each one after one ;
- BF customer id. just an iteration from 0X00 to 0XFF on the first byte ;
- Load Dump file : Load an existing EM4100 dump generated by Flipperzero, select an index and bruteforce from 0X00 to 0XFF;
- Uids list: loop over a text file (one uid per line)
