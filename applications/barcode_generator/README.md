This is a UPC-A Barcode generator for the flipper zero hardware.

It will eventually be expanded in to other barcode types. It currently only generates UPC-A type barcodes.

It does not perform any safety or sanity check. It simply converts the 12 digit number input in to the UPC-A barcode standard.

I haven't tested this with any true barcode scanners, but I have used it with numerous mobile phone apps and it seems to work just fine (when the barcode passes the sanity check built in to the UPC-A standard)

Hitting the centre button on the flipper toggles edit mode.
When in edit mode, left and right will change the digit to be changed, and up and down will adjust the digit value.
