## DTMF Dolphin

DTMF (Dual-Tone Multi-Frequency) dialer, Bluebox, and Redbox.

Now in a release-ready state for both Dialer, Bluebox, and Redbox (US/UK) functionality!

Please note that using the current tone output method, the 2600 tone is scaled about 33 Hz higher than it should be. This is a limitation of the current sample rate.
