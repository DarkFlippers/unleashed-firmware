# Flipfrid

Basic EM4100 and HIDProx Fuzzer.

## Why

Flipfrid is a simple Rfid fuzzer using EM4100 protocol (125khz).
Objective is to provide a simple to use fuzzer to test readers by emulating various cards.

- EM4100 cards use a 1 byte customer id and 4 bytes card id. 
- HIDProx cards use a 2 byte customer id and 3 byte card id.

## How

1) Select the Protocol with the left and right arrows
2) Select the Mode with the up and down arrows

### Info 

There are 2 Protocols:
- EM4100
- HIDProx

There are 4 modes:
- Default Values: Try factory/default keys and emulate one after the other.
- BF customer id: An iteration from 0X00 to 0XFF on the first byte.
- Load Dump file: Load an existing dump (.rfid) generated by Flipperzero, select an index and bruteforce from 0X00 to 0XFF;
- Uids list: Iterate over an input text file (one uid per line) and emulate one after the other.




TODO : 
- blank screen on back press 
- Add second byte test to `BF customer id`
