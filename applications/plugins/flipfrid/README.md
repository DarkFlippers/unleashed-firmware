# Flipfrid

Basic EM4100 and HIDProx Fuzzer.

## Why

Flipfrid is a simple Rfid fuzzer using EM4100 protocol (125khz).
Objective is to provide a simple to use fuzzer to test readers by emulating various cards.

EM4100 cards use a 1 byte customer id and 4 bytes card id.
HIDProx cards use a 2 byte customer id and 3 byte card id.

## How

There are 8 modes :
- EM4100 - Default key loop over 16 factory/default keys and emulate each one after one;
- EM4100 - BF customer id. just an iteration from 0X00 to 0XFF on the first byte ;
- EM4100 - Load Dump file : Load an existing EM4100 dump generated by Flipperzero, select an index and bruteforce from 0X00 to 0XFF;
- EM4100 - Uids list: loop over a text file (one uid per line)
- HIDProx - Default key loop over 16 factory/default keys and emulate each one after one;
- HIDProx - BF customer id. just an iteration from 0X00 to 0XFF on the first byte ;
- HIDProx - Load Dump file : Load an existing EM4100 dump generated by Flipperzero, select an index and bruteforce from 0X00 to 0XFF;
- HIDProx - Uids list: loop over a text file (one uid per line)

TODO : 
- blank screen on back press 
- Add second byte test to `BF customer id`
