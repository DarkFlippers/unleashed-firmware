# Dolphin counter
This is a simple plugin for the [Flipper Zero](https://www.flipperzero.one).
It gives you access to a counter which you can increment and decrement using the up and down buttons respectively.

# How to install this?
I'd recommend using [flipperzero-ufbt](https://github.com/flipperdevices/flipperzero-ufbt), which is a lightweight tool for quickly testing Flipper Zero applications. The app will stay present on your device so it is not necessary to flash the entire firmware.
