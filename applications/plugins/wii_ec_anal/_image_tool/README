1.	Prepare the image
	a. 	Open your *black and white* image in GIMP
	b. 	File -> Export As
			filename: EXAMPLE.c
			Type    : "C source code"
		[Export]
			prefixed name: gimp_image
			Comment      : <any>
			[x] Use GLib types
			[ ] <<all other options>>
			Opacity      : 100%
		[Export]

2.	Prepare conversion tool [stored in (eg.) /path/]
	a.	cp  _convert*.*  /path/
	b.	cp  EXAMPLE.c    /path/

3.	Run the conversion tool
	a.	cd  /path/
	b.	./_convert.sh  EXAMPLE.c

4.	All being well, you will see an ascii version of your image.
	If not, then you're gonna have to submit a bug report <shrug>

5.	You should now have a directory called img_/
	In that directory should be
		img_EXAMPLE.c - The data for your new image
		img_*.c       - The data for other images
		images.h      - A header for ALL images that have been created in this directory
		images.c      - A sample FlipperZero show() function [not optimised]
