# flipperzero-nrf24 

An [NRF24](https://www.sparkfun.com/datasheets/Components/SMD/nRF24L01Pluss_Preliminary_Product_Specification_v1_0.pdf) driver for the [Flipper Zero](https://flipperzero.one/) device. The NRF24 is a popular line of 2.4GHz radio transceivers from Nordic Semiconductors. This library is not currently complete, but functional.

## Warning
This repo contains two Flipper Zero apps that utilize the NRF24 driver to sniff for NRF24 addresses and perform mousejack attacks. These apps are for **educational purposes** only. Please use this code responsibly and only use these apps on your own equipment.

## Acknowledgments
The NRF24 sniffing technique was discovered and shared by Travis Goodspeed in [his blog](http://travisgoodspeed.blogspot.com/2011/02/promiscuity-is-nrf24l01s-duty.html).

The mousejack vulnerabilities were discovered and reported by Marc Newlin, see [the blog](https://www.bastille.net/research/vulnerabilities/mousejack/technical-details) for technical details.

Much of the driver code was inspired by [RadioHead's Arduino library](https://www.airspayce.com/mikem/arduino/RadioHead/classRH__NRF24.html).
Much of the mousejack code was inspired by the [Jackit project](https://github.com/insecurityofthings/jackit).

If the nRF module is acting a bit flakey, try adding a capacitor to the vcc/gnd lines! I've not tried the Plus model so it may have a bigger need for a cap. Otherwise, I haven't had any major issues. Anything from a 3.3 uF to 10 uF should do. (Watch your positive/negative placement! Negative to ground.) I learned if you wanna get fancy, include a 0.1 uF cap in parallel. The 3.3 uF to 10 uF will respond to slow freq changes while the 0.1 uF will respond to the high freq switching spikes that the larger one cannot. That said, a single 10 uF will likely suffice for the Mousejack attack. ¯\\\_(ツ)_/¯
