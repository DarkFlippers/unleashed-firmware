# Bootloader

Bootloader must be flashed first.
Detailed instruction on how to compile and flash it you can find in `bootloader` folder.

# OS

CMSIS-RTOS2 over FreeRTOS

## Platform code

CMSIS, Freertos and HAL files are generated by CubeMX.
You can find platform code for STM32WB55 version in `f4` folder:

```
├── Inc                             # CubeMX generated headers
├── Src                             # CubeMX generated code
├── api-hal                         # Our HAL wrappers and platform specifics
├── ble-glue                        # BLE specific code(Glue for STMWPAN)
├── f4.ioc                          # CubeMX project file
├── startup_stm32wb55xx_cm4.s       # Board startup/initialization assembler code
├── stm32wb55xx_flash_cm4*.ld       # Linker scripts
├── target.mk                       # Makefile include

```

Working with CubeMX:
1. Download CubeMX from [st.com](https://www.st.com/en/development-tools/stm32cubemx.html)
2. Open `*.ioc` file
3. Do whatever you want to
3. Click `generate code`
4. After regenerating, look at git status, regeneration may brake some files.
5. Check one more time that things that you've changes are not covered in platform api-hal. Because you know...

# Flipper Universal Registry Implementation (FURI)

FURI is used to:

* application control (start, exit, switch between active)
* data exchange between application (create/open channel, subscribe and push messages or read/write values)
* non-volatile data storage for application (create/open value and read/write)

Read more at [FURI page](FURI)

# FS (not implemented)

File system is used to volaile storage some files (config, application data, etc.). There are some folders mounted to different volumes:

* `/usr` for store static data like assets, menu items. Build system add files to usr while building. It can be useful for exchange some static data between application. For example, your app can add link to itself to Plugins menu items file, user will see your app and can call it from this menu.
* Specially `/usr/etc-default` folder contains default configs for apps. Bootloader has `factory default` options to reset applications config. Also when new app is bootstapping, system copy files from default config folder to `/etc`.
* `/etc` for store configs of application. This volume not overwrite during flashing.
* `/var` for store some application data (saved keys, application database, logs). This volume also not overwrite during flashing.
* `/media/*` mounted if SD card is inserted.

# Flipper applications

Each flipper functionality except OS/HAL/FURI doing by Flipper application. Some application are called at startup, the rest are called by the user (for example, from menu).

(you can see some [examples](Application-examples))

For exchange data between application each app expose own record in FURI. You can subscribe on/read record to get data from application and write to record to send data to application.
