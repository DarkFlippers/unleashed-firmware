/**
 * @file nfc.h
 * @brief Transport layer Nfc library.
 *
 * The Nfc layer is responsible for setting the operating mode (poller or listener)
 * and technology (ISO14443-3A/B, ISO15693, ...), data exchange between higher
 * protocol-specific levels and underlying NFC hardware, as well as timings handling.
 *
 * In applications using the NFC protocol system there is no need to neiter explicitly
 * create an Nfc instance nor call any of its functions, as it is all handled
 * automatically under the hood.
 *
 * If the NFC protocol system is not suitable for the application's intended purpose
 * or there is need of having direct access to the NFC transport layer, then an Nfc
 * instance must be allocated and the below functions shall be used to implement
 * the required logic.
