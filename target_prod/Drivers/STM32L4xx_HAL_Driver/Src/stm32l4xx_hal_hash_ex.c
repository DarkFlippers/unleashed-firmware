  * @brief   Extended HASH HAL module driver.
  *          This file provides firmware functions to manage the following
  *          functionalities of the HASH peripheral for SHA-224 and SHA-256
  *          alogrithms:
  *           + HASH or HMAC processing in polling mode
  *           + HASH or HMAC processing in interrupt mode
  *           + HASH or HMAC processing in DMA mode
  *         Additionally, this file provides functions to manage HMAC
  *         multi-buffer DMA-based processing for MD-5, SHA-1, SHA-224
  *         and SHA-256.

                     ##### HASH peripheral extended features  #####
 ===============================================================================
    [..]
    The SHA-224 and SHA-256 HASH and HMAC processing can be carried out exactly
    the same way as for SHA-1 or MD-5 algorithms.
    (#) Three modes are available.
        (##) Polling mode: processing APIs are blocking functions
             i.e. they process the data and wait till the digest computation is finished,
             e.g. HAL_HASHEx_xxx_Start()
        (##) Interrupt mode: processing APIs are not blocking functions
                i.e. they process the data under interrupt,
                e.g. HAL_HASHEx_xxx_Start_IT()
        (##) DMA mode: processing APIs are not blocking functions and the CPU is
             not used for data transfer i.e. the data transfer is ensured by DMA,
                e.g. HAL_HASHEx_xxx_Start_DMA(). Note that in DMA mode, a call to
                HAL_HASHEx_xxx_Finish() is then required to retrieve the digest.

   (#)Multi-buffer processing is possible in polling, interrupt and DMA modes.
        (##) In polling mode, only multi-buffer HASH processing is possible.
             API HAL_HASHEx_xxx_Accumulate() must be called for each input buffer, except for the last one.
             User must resort to HAL_HASHEx_xxx_Start() to enter the last one and retrieve as
             well the computed digest.

        (##) In interrupt mode, API HAL_HASHEx_xxx_Accumulate_IT() must be called for each input buffer, 
             except for the last one.
             User must resort to HAL_HASHEx_xxx_Start_IT() to enter the last one and retrieve as
             well the computed digest.

        (##) In DMA mode, multi-buffer HASH and HMAC processing are possible.

              (+++) HASH processing: once initialization is done, MDMAT bit must be set thru __HAL_HASH_SET_MDMAT() macro.
             From that point, each buffer can be fed to the Peripheral thru HAL_HASHEx_xxx_Start_DMA() API.
             Before entering the last buffer, reset the MDMAT bit with __HAL_HASH_RESET_MDMAT()
             macro then wrap-up the HASH processing in feeding the last input buffer thru the
             same API HAL_HASHEx_xxx_Start_DMA(). The digest can then be retrieved with a call to
             API HAL_HASHEx_xxx_Finish().

             (+++) HMAC processing (MD-5, SHA-1, SHA-224 and SHA-256 must all resort to
             extended functions): after initialization, the key and the first input buffer are entered
             in the Peripheral with the API HAL_HMACEx_xxx_Step1_2_DMA(). This carries out HMAC step 1 and
             starts step 2.
             The following buffers are next entered with the API  HAL_HMACEx_xxx_Step2_DMA(). At this
             point, the HMAC processing is still carrying out step 2.
             Then, step 2 for the last input buffer and step 3 are carried out by a single call
             to HAL_HMACEx_xxx_Step2_3_DMA().

             The digest can finally be retrieved with a call to API HAL_HASH_xxx_Finish() for
             MD-5 and SHA-1, to HAL_HASHEx_xxx_Finish() for SHA-224 and SHA-256.

    [..]  This section provides functions allowing to calculate in polling mode
          the hash value using one of the following algorithms:

      (+) SHA256

         (++) HAL_HASHEx_SHA256_Accumulate()

    [..] For a single buffer to be hashed, user can resort to HAL_HASH_xxx_Start().

    [..]  In case of multi-buffer HASH processing (a single digest is computed while
          several buffers are fed to the Peripheral), the user can resort to successive calls
          to HAL_HASHEx_xxx_Accumulate() and wrap-up the digest computation by a call
          to HAL_HASHEx_xxx_Start().

    [..]  User must first start-up the multi-buffer DMA-based HMAC computation in
          calling HAL_HMACEx_xxx_Step1_2_DMA(). This carries out HMAC step 1 and
          intiates step 2 with the first input buffer.

    [..]  The following buffers are next fed to the Peripheral with a call to the API
          HAL_HMACEx_xxx_Step2_DMA(). There may be several consecutive calls
          to this API.

    [..]  Multi-buffer DMA-based HMAC computation is wrapped up by a call to
          HAL_HMACEx_xxx_Step2_3_DMA(). This finishes step 2 in feeding the last input
          buffer to the Peripheral then carries out step 3.

    [..]  Digest is retrieved by a call to HAL_HASH_xxx_Finish() for MD-5 or
          SHA-1, to HAL_HASHEx_xxx_Finish() for SHA-224 or SHA-256.

    [..]  If only two buffers need to be consecutively processed, a call to
