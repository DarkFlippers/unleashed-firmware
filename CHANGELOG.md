### New changes
* Picopass plugin fixed (bug with mbedtls lib found and fixed by hedger in OFW PR 1742)
* DFU files no longer included in releases to avoid issues with wrong manual installation of assets - use web updater or microSD update package

**Note: To avoid issues prefer installing using web updater or by self update package, all needed assets will be installed**

Self-update package (update from microSD) - `flipper-z-f7-update-(version).zip` or `.tgz` for iOS mobile app

DFU for update using qFlipper is no longer included in releases to avoid issues with assets - Use Web Updater or self-update package!
