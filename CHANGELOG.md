### New changes
* .sub playlist plugin [(by darmiel)](https://github.com/darmiel/flipper-playlist) (PR #62)
* HW Region will be reported as 0 so it won't call subghz provisioning in apps (I hope)

**Note: To avoid issues prefer installing using web updater or by self update package, all needed assets will be installed**

Self-update package (update from microSD) - `flipper-z-f7-update-(version).zip` or `.tgz` for iOS mobile app

DFU for update using qFlipper - `flipper-z-f7-full-(version).dfu`

If using DFU update method, download this archive and unpack it to your microSD, replacing all files except files you have edited manually -
`sd-card-(version).zip`
