 *
 * Create a new task and add it to the list of tasks that are ready to run.
 *
 * Internally, within the FreeRTOS implementation, tasks use two blocks of
 * memory.  The first block is used to hold the task's data structures.  The
 * second block is used by the task as its stack.  If a task is created using
 * xTaskCreate() then both blocks of memory are automatically dynamically
 * allocated inside the xTaskCreate() function.  (see
 * http://www.freertos.org/a00111.html).  If a task is created using
 * xTaskCreateStatic() then the application writer must provide the required
 * memory.  xTaskCreateStatic() therefore allows a task to be created without
 * using any dynamic memory allocation.
 *
 * See xTaskCreateStatic() for a version that does not use any dynamic memory
 * allocation.
 *
 * xTaskCreate() can only be used to create a task that has unrestricted
 * access to the entire microcontroller memory map.  Systems that include MPU
 * support can alternatively create an MPU constrained task using
 * xTaskCreateRestricted().
 *
 * @param pvTaskCode Pointer to the task entry function.  Tasks
 * must be implemented to never return (i.e. continuous loop).
 *
 * @param pcName A descriptive name for the task.  This is mainly used to
 * facilitate debugging.  Max length defined by configMAX_TASK_NAME_LEN - default
 * is 16.
 *
 * @param usStackDepth The size of the task stack specified as the number of
 * variables the stack can hold - not the number of bytes.  For example, if
 * the stack is 16 bits wide and usStackDepth is defined as 100, 200 bytes
 * will be allocated for stack storage.
 *
 * @param pvParameters Pointer that will be used as the parameter for the task
 * being created.
 *
 * @param uxPriority The priority at which the task should run.  Systems that
 * include MPU support can optionally create tasks in a privileged (system)
 * mode by setting bit portPRIVILEGE_BIT of the priority parameter.  For
 * example, to create a privileged task at priority 2 the uxPriority parameter
 * should be set to ( 2 | portPRIVILEGE_BIT ).
 *
 * @param pvCreatedTask Used to pass back a handle by which the created task
 * can be referenced.
 *

 * list, otherwise an error code defined in the file projdefs.h

 *
 * Delay a task for a given number of ticks.  The actual time that the

 * rate - with the resolution of one tick period.
 *
 * INCLUDE_vTaskDelay must be defined as 1 for this function to be available.

 *
 *
 * vTaskDelay() specifies a time at which the task wishes to unblock relative to
 * the time at which vTaskDelay() is called.  For example, specifying a block
 * period of 100 ticks will cause the task to unblock 100 ticks after
 * vTaskDelay() is called.  vTaskDelay() does not therefore provide a good method
 * of controlling the frequency of a periodic task as the path taken through the
 * code, as well as other task and interrupt activity, will effect the frequency
 * at which vTaskDelay() gets called and therefore the time at which the task
 * next executes.  See vTaskDelayUntil() for an alternative API function designed
 * to facilitate fixed frequency execution.  It does this by specifying an
 * absolute time (rather than a relative time) at which the calling task should
 * unblock.
 *
 * @param xTicksToDelay The amount of time, in tick periods, that

 *
 * Delay a task until a specified time.  This function can be used by periodic
 * tasks to ensure a constant execution frequency.
 *
 * This function differs from vTaskDelay () in one important aspect:  vTaskDelay () will
 * cause a task to block for the specified number of ticks from the time vTaskDelay () is
 * called.  It is therefore difficult to use vTaskDelay () by itself to generate a fixed
 * execution frequency as the time between a task starting to execute and that task
 * calling vTaskDelay () may not be fixed [the task may take a different path though the
 * code between calls, or may get interrupted or preempted a different number of times
 * each time it executes].
 *
 * Whereas vTaskDelay () specifies a wake time relative to the time at which the function
 * is called, vTaskDelayUntil () specifies the absolute (exact) time at which it wishes to
 * unblock.
 *
 * The constant portTICK_PERIOD_MS can be used to calculate real time from the tick
 * rate - with the resolution of one tick period.
 *
 * @param pxPreviousWakeTime Pointer to a variable that holds the time at which the
 * task was last unblocked.  The variable must be initialised with the current time

 * automatically updated within vTaskDelayUntil ().
 *
 * @param xTimeIncrement The cycle time period.  The task will be unblocked at
