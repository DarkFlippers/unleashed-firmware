# Executing code from RAM

In Flipper firmware, we have a special boot mode that loads a specially crafted system image into RAM and transfers control to it. System image executing in RAM has full write access to whole Flipper's flash memory — something that's not possible when running main code from same flash.

We leverage that boot mode to perform OTA firmware updates, including operations on radio stack running on second MCU core.


# How does Flipper OTA work?

Installation of OTA updates goes through 3 stages:

## 1. Backing up internal storage (`/int/`)

It is a special partition of Flipper's flash memory, taking up all available space not used by firmware code. Newer versions of firmware may be of different size, and simply installing them would cause flash repartitioning and data loss.

So, before taking any action upon the firmware, we back up current configuration from `/int/` into a plain tar archive on SD card.


## 2. Performing device update

For that, main firmware loads an updater image - a customized build of main Flipper firmware — into RAM and runs it. Updater performs operations on system flash that are described by an Update manifest file.

First, if there's a Radio stack image bundled with the update, updater compares its version with currently installed one. If they don't match, updater performs stack deinstallation followed by writing and installing a new one. The installation itself is performed by proprietary software, FUS, running on Core2, and leads to a series of system restarts.

Then updater validates and corrects Option Bytes — a special memory region containing low-level configuration for Flipper's MCU.

After that, updater loads a `.dfu` file with firmware to be flashed, checks its integrity using CRC32, writes it to system flash and validates written data.


## 3. Restoring internal storage and updating resources

After performing operations on flash memory, system restarts into newly flashed firmware. Then it performs restoration of previously backed up `/int` contents.

If update package contains an additional resources archive, it is extracted onto SD card.


# Update manifest

Update packages come with a manifest that contains a description of its contents. The manifest is in Flipper File Format — a simple text file, comprised of key-value pairs.

## Mandatory fields

Update manifest must contain the following keys in given order:

* __Filetype__: a constant string, "Flipper firmware upgrade configuration";

* __Version__: manifest version. Current value is 2;

* __Info__: arbitraty string, describing package contents;

* __Target__: hardware revision the package is built for;

* __Loader__: file name of stage 2 loader that is executed from RAM;

* __Loader CRC__: CRC32 of loader file. Note that it is represented in little-endian hex.

## Optional fields

Other fields may have empty values, is such case updater skips all operations related to such values.

* __Radio__: file name of radio stack image, provided by STM;

* __Radio address__: address to install the radio stack at. It is specified in Release Notes by STM;

* __Radio version__: Radio major, minor and sub versions followed by branch, release, and stack type packed into 6 hex-encoded bytes;

* __Radio CRC__: CRC32 of radio image;

* __Resources__: file name of TAR acrhive with resources to be extracted on SD card;

* __OB reference__, __OB mask__, __OB write mask__: reference values for validating and correcting option bytes.


# OTA update error codes

We designed the OTA update process to be as fail-safe as possible. We don't start any risky operation before validating all related pieces of data to ensure we don't leave the device in partially updated, or bricked, state.

Even if something goes wrong, Updater gives you an option to retry failed operations, and reports its state with an error code. These error codes have an `[XX-YY]` format, where `XX` encodes an operation that failed, and `YY` contains extra details on its progress where the error occured.

# Building update packages


## Full package

To build full update package, including firmware, radio stack and resources for SD card, run `./fbt COMPACT=1 DEBUG=0 updater_package`


## Minimal package

To build minimal update package, including only firmware, run `./fbt COMPACT=1 DEBUG=0 updater_minpackage`


## Customizing update bundles

Default update packages are built with Bluetooth Light stack. 
You can pick a different stack, if your firmware version supports it, and build a bundle with it passing stack type and binary name to `fbt`: 

`./fbt updater_package COMPACT=1 DEBUG=0 COPRO_OB_DATA=scripts/ob_custradio.data COPRO_STACK_BIN=stm32wb5x_BLE_Stack_full_fw.bin COPRO_STACK_TYPE=ble_full`  

Note that `COPRO_OB_DATA` must point to a valid file in `scripts` folder containing reference Option Byte data matching to your radio stack type.

In certain cases, you might have to confirm your intentions by adding `COPRO_DISCLAIMER=...` to the build command line.


## Building partial update packages

You can customize package contents by calling `scripts/update.py` directly. 
For example, to build a package only for installing BLE FULL stack:

```shell
scripts/update.py generate \
	-t f7 -d r13.3_full -v "BLE FULL 13.3" \
	--stage dist/f7/flipper-z-f7-updater-*.bin \
	--radio lib/STM32CubeWB/Projects/STM32WB_Copro_Wireless_Binaries/STM32WB5x/stm32wb5x_BLE_Stack_full_fw.bin \
	--radiotype ble_full
```

For full list of options, check `scripts/update.py generate` help.
