# How to use Flipper as a new SubGHz remote (not clone of original remote)

### If your system is not added here that doesn't mean flipper don't support it! Look into add manually menu, and search for your manufacturers inscturctions!
### Also many supported systems can be used only from `Read` mode, `Add Manually` is used only to make new remotes that can be binded with receiver

How to get seed to make full clone of your remote (**will conflict with original remote!!!!!**):

**WARNING!!!! This method can desync your original remote, please avoid using it! It can be used in rare cases like when your remote works poorly or has broken buttons and you want to replace it with flipper**

1. Open `Read` in SubGHz on your flipper
2. (ONLY FOR ORIGINAL REMOTES) Hold all buttons on your remote at same time, example -> for 2 button remote - press them both at same time and hold OR press hidden button on back of remote with a pin or paper clip
3. You will receive signal on your flipper, open that signal and see `Fix:` value, it should start from `F` like `F00F1C9B`
4. If `Fix:` is showing first `F` see `Hop:` value -> This is your remote Seed
5. Write down Hop value
6. Press button on your remote that you want to clone and receive its signal on your flipper
7. Open and write down `Fix:` value where first digit will be same as your button ID `Btn:`
8. Create new remote using BFT Mitto [Manual] - Enter FIX from step 7, enter counter `FF F9`, enter seed from step 5
9. Using counter values like `FF F9` can help bypassing current original remote counter value, and in result it also can fully desync original remote, only one remote can work at same time using this method
10. Throw away your original remote since now it needs to be re-added into receiver board :C

## Nice Flor S

- Create new remote with randomly generated serial: Go to SubGHz -> Add Manually -> Nice FloR-S 433Mhz
- Open your new remote file

### Coding using an existing remote
To enter the code of a new remote control without using your receiver, you will need
an authorised remote control (note: the first remote control must always be entered
using the receiver key). Now, with the two remote controls (your already coded
remote, and your new remote), which we shall call NEW (the one whose code we want
to enter) and OLD (the authorised one), position yourself within 3m of the gate/garage
receiver and then:
1. Press and hold the `Send` button on the flipper for at least 5 seconds and then
release.
2. Press the button on the already programmed remote 3 times slowly.
3. Press the `Send` button on the flipper slowly and then release.

### Coding directly to your receiver
Your new remote will program to your receiver as per your original remote
instructions, so please refer to your manual. But for a typical NICE FLOX2R Receiver,
the programming procedure is as follows:
1. Press the learning button on your receiver for 1-2 seconds. The LED will turn on
for 5 seconds. Within 5 seconds, complete the next step.
2. Press a `Send` button on your flipper until the LED on your receiver turns off.
3. Release the remote button and wait for 2 seconds.
4. Press the `Send` button on your flipper again. The LED on your receiver
will now flash 3 times. This indicates that your remote has been successfully
coded. If this does not happen, repeat the whole procedure from the
beginning, and try again.
5. Wait 5 seconds. Press the button on your new remote to test if it opens your
garage/gate.
