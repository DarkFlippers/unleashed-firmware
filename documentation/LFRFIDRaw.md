# Reading RAW RFID data

Flipper Zero has the option to read RAW data from 125 kHz cards that allows you to record the card's data and save it, similar to how a dictaphone records sound.

To use this function, you need to activate the Debug mode on your Flipper Zero by doing the following:

1. Go to **Main Menu** → **Settings** → **System**.

2. Set **Debug** to **ON**.

Once the Debug mode is activated on your Flipper Zero, you can read RAW data from 125 kHz RFID cards:

1. Go to **Main Menu** → **125 kHz RFID** → **Extra Actions**.

2. Select **RAW RFID** data and name the raw file.

3. Read instructions and press **OK**.

4. Apply the card to Flipper Zero's back.

5. Once the reading is finished, press **OK**.

Two files with data (with ASK and PSK modulations) will be saved in the `lfrfid` folder on the microSD card. Now, you can share it and the card's photo with developers by creating an issue on GitHub.
