### Description

Filename extension: `.ir`

This file format is used to store an infrared remote that consists of an arbitrary number of buttons.
Each button is separated from others by a comment character (`#`) for better readability.

Known protocols are represented in the `parsed` form, whereas non-recognized signals may be saved and re-transmitted as `raw` data.

## Infrared Library File Format

### Examples

- [TV Universal Library](/assets/resources/infrared/assets/tv.ir)
- [A/C Universal Library](/assets/resources/infrared/assets/ac.ir)
- [Audio Universal Library](/assets/resources/infrared/assets/audio.ir)

### Description

Filename extension: `.ir`

This file format is used to store universal remote libraries. It is identical to the previous format, differing only in the `Filetype` field.\
It also has predefined button names for each universal library type, so that the universal remote application can understand them.
See [Universal Remotes](/documentation/UniversalRemotes.md) for more information.

### Version history:

1. Initial version.

## Infrared Test File Format

### Examples

See [Infrared Unit Tests](/assets/unit_tests/infrared/) for various examples.

### Description

Filename extension: `.irtest`

This file format is used to store technical test data that is too large to keep directly in the firmware.
It is mostly similar to the two previous formats, with the main difference being the addition of the parsed signal arrays.

Each infrared protocol must have corresponding unit tests complete with an `.irtest` file.

Known protocols are represented in the `parsed_array` form, whereas raw data has the `raw` type.\
Note: a single parsed signal must be represented as an array of size 1.

#### Signal names

The signal names in an `.irtest` file follow a convention `<name><test_number>`, where the name is one of:

- decoder_input
- decoder_expected
- encoder_decoder_input,

and the number is a sequential integer: 1, 2, 3, etc., which produces names like `decoder_input1`, `encoder_decoder_input3`, and so on.

| Name                  | Type         | Description                                                                                           |
| --------------------- | ------------ | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| decoder_input         | raw          | A raw signal containing the decoder input. Also used as the expected encoder output.               |
| decoder_expected      | parsed_array | An array of parsed signals containing the expected decoder output. Also used as the encoder input. |
| encoder_decoder_input | parsed_array | An array of parsed signals containing both the encoder-decoder input and expected output.             |
