# NFC Flipper File Formats

## UID + Header (General format)

### Example

    Filetype: Flipper NFC device
    Version: 4
    # Device type can be ISO14443-3A, ISO14443-3B, ISO14443-4A, NTAG/Ultralight, Mifare Classic, Mifare DESFire
    Device type: ISO14443-4A
    # UID is common for all formats
    UID: 04 48 6A 32 33 58 80
    -------------------------
    (Device-specific data)

### Description

This file format is used to store the device type and the UID of an NFC device. It does not store any internal data, so it is only used as a header for other formats.

Version differences:

1. Initial version, deprecated
2. LSB ATQA (e.g. 4400 instead of 0044)
3. MSB ATQA (current version)
4. Replace UID device type with ISO14443-3A

### Description

This file format is used to store the UID, SAK and ATQA of a Mifare Ultralight/NTAG device. It also stores the internal data of the card, the signature, the version, and the counters. The data is stored in pages, just like on the card itself.

The "NTAG/Ultralight type" field contains the concrete device type. It must be one of: Mifare Ultralight, Mifare Ultralight 11, Mifare Ultralight 21, NTAG203, NTAG213, NTAG215, NTAG216, NTAG I2C 1K, NTAG I2C 2K, NTAG I2C Plus 1K, NTAG I2C Plus 2K.

The "Signature" field contains the reply of the tag to the READ_SIG command. More on that can be found here: <https://www.nxp.com/docs/en/data-sheet/MF0ULX1.pdf> (page 31)

The "Mifare version" field is not related to the file format version but to the Mifare Ultralight version. It contains the response of the tag to the GET_VERSION command. More on that can be found here: <https://www.nxp.com/docs/en/data-sheet/MF0ULX1.pdf> (page 21)

Other fields are the direct representation of the card's internal state. Learn more about them in the same datasheet.

Version differences:

1. Mifare Ultralight type is stored directly in Device type field
2. Current version, Mifare Ultralight type is stored in the same-named field

## Mifare Classic

### Description

This file format is used to store the NFC-A and Mifare Classic specific data of a Mifare Classic card. Aside from the NFC-A data, it stores the card type (1K/4K) and the internal data of the card. The data is stored in blocks, there is no sector grouping. If the block's data is unknown, it is represented by '??'. Otherwise, the data is represented as a hex string.

Version differences:

1. Initial version, has Key A and Key B masks instead of marking unknown data with '??'.

Example:

    ...
    Data format version: 1
    # Key map is the bit mask indicating valid key in each sector
    Key A map: 000000000000FFFF
    Key B map: 000000000000FFFF
    # Mifare Classic blocks
    ...

2. Current version

## Mifare DESFire

### Description

This file format is used to store the NFC-A and Mifare DESFire specific data of a Mifare DESFire card. Aside from the NFC-A data, it stores the card type (DESFire) and the internal data of the card. The data is stored per-application, and per-file. Here, the card was written using those pm3 commands:

    hf mfdes createapp --aid 123456 --fid 2345 --dfname astra
    hf mfdes createfile --aid 123456 --fid 01 --isofid 0001 --size 000100
    hf mfdes write --aid 123456 --fid 01 -d 1337

Version differences:
None, there are no versions yet.
