### Pass-code lock

Flipper will store your secrets like U2F token and house keys. What if Flipper gets lost?

Well, no problem! For this case, we made a locking feature. You can lock Flipper and unlock it with the special pass-combo, like in good old fighting games (for example, →↑↑←↓↑↓). Users can set a pass-combo of any length, and all functions will be blocked until the combo is entered, including firmware flashing.
