# Discord 

For quick communication and voice calls we use Discord. Please ask for `Contributor` role to use developers channels.

## Link to Discord server: https://flipperzero.one/discord

Separating roles and channels in this way:

###  Roles

* Everyone 
* Contributors — everyone who has access to our Github
* Staff — people working in-house 
* Admins — staff members who can manage permissions 

### Channels

Right now I just separate contributors from everyone, to prevent a flood. Later we can create more voice and text channels for firmware/hardware/creative department.
