# Hardware

[Hardware specification](Hardware-specification)

### Releases

All PCB releases named according to the following rules:

* `F` mean fw target. Different F-versions has different firmware.
* `B` mean body. Different B-versions has mechanical incompatibility. If B=0, PCB is not intended for installation in a case.
* `C` mean interConnections. If ะก=0, device contain single board and no interconnections. Otherwise, different C-versions is incompatible to each other.
* Number afer point mean sequential numbering of release.

List of releases:

* [Version 0 (F1B1C0)](Hardware-version-F1B1C0.0)
* [Version 1 (F2B0C1)](Hardware-version-F2B0C1.1)
