Hello and welcome

We make some PoC firmware: check hardware feature and UI example.

Now we start PO-NASTOYASCHEMU!

Phase 1: warm-up

Create some community, contribution guide, IDE integration, build and test/CI system.
Describe all feature and close to its implementation.
Choose OS/HAL, maybe Rust.
Implement basic API.
Implement emulator. (target:Emul)
Implement remote debug testbench (target:F1)
Describe bootloader and linking system.
Begin developing applications.

Up to 10 sep.

Phase 2: hardware gen 1

Send contributor's kit to contributors.
Implement bootloader, core, tests.
PlatformIO/Arduino integration.
Debug developing applications on real hw (target:F2)

Up to 30 sep.

Phase 3: hardware gen 2

Send contributor's kit with BLE/other HW fixes.
