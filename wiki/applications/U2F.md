Flipper Zero can act as a fully functional U2F key, that works with any U2F-enabled services such as Google, Twitter, Facebook, Dropbox, LastPass, Amazon AWS, and many others.

Universal 2nd Factor (U2F) protocol is an open standard for hardware security tokens used for secure authentication. Developed by Google, Yubico, and NXP, U2F acts as a universal key that is designed to add another layer to the traditional login+password authentication method.

Even if your password gets compromised, an attacker will not be able to log in to your account. This method is much stronger than the usual SMS 2nd-factor method, as it doesnâ€™t involve any third-parties like a cell phone operator.
