![Flipper Zero RFID](https://habrastorage.org/webt/jd/fb/yb/jdfbybzgw6qvg5kjeuvfg8w0iou.png)

Low-frequency proximity cards are widely used in access control systems around the world. It's pretty dumb, keeps only a short few-byte ID, and has no authentication mechanism, allowing it to be easily read, cloned, and emulated by anyone. A 125 kHz antenna is located on the bottom of Flipper's body.
