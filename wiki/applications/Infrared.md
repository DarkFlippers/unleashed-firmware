## Signal library

Flipper contains a built-in library of common remote commands like:

* Switching ON/OFF and changing volume of popular TV brands
* Switching ON/OFF of popular air conditioners brands

This library is constantly updated by Flipper community users that upload new signals to Flipper's IR remote database. This library is **located on SD-card and not included on firmware**.

## Infrared learning feature

At the same time, the IR receiver can catch signals and save them to the memory, so you can store any of your personal remotes and transmit it later, as well as upload it to the public database to share with other Flipper users. 

Flipper's infrared receiver can automatically detect baud rate, frequency, and modulation of most IR remotes signals and captures it without any configuration. To learn new signal, user should point IR remote  directly into Flipper receiver on distance 10-15 cm.
