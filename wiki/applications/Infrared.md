The infrared transmitter can send any signal to control electronics such as TV, air conditioners, stereo systems, and others.

## Signal library

Flipper contains a built-in library of common remote commands like switching on/off, changing volume or adjusting temperature, and so on. This library is constantly updated by Flipper community users that upload new signals to Flipper's IR remote database.

## Infrared learning feature

At the same time, the IR receiver can catch signals and save them to the memory, so you can store any of your personal remotes and transmit it later, as well as upload it to the public database to share with other Flipper users. 

Flipper's infrared eye can automatically detect baud rate, frequency, and modulation of the IR signals it captures without any configuration. That allows you to easily capture and store signals from all your remotes and other IR appliances.
