# Flipper Zero Firmware community repo

![](https://github.com/Flipper-Zero/wiki/blob/master/images/firmware-wiki-header.gif)

Welcome to [Flipper Zero](https://flipperzero.one/zero)'s Firmware repo! Our goal is to create nice and clean code along with good documentation, to make it a pleasure for everyone to work with. This repo will become completely public closer to the device shipping date. 

# Current state of Flipper developement

## Hardware

Current Flipper Zero prototype is based on board [Version 0 (F1B1C0.0)](https://github.com/Flipper-Zero/flipperzero-firmware-community/wiki/Hardware-version-F1B1C0.0) that have a lots of bugs. We have finished the next version of PCB, where these bugs fixed, and now waiting for it from manufacturing. This new board will be used as Developer Kit for early firmware development. 

## Firmware

While early prototyping of Flipper Zero we have used a lot of 3rd-party code, sketches, and dirty demos just to prove that it can work, don't think too much about architecture. It splited into many incompatible pieces of code, and some of them not even have a UI. This repo is cleaned from all dirty demos and prepared for contributors, so we will start to porting all legacy code here, following new architecture.  

Right now we are working on clean architecture and documentation for contributors. You can run firmware locally (with HAL stub).

* `docker-compose exec dev make -C target_lo` for build
* `docker-compose exec dev target_lo/build/target_lo` for run

# Flipper developement roadmap

* ~~**Phase 0** Preparing for Kickstarter, prototyping UI, checkng hardware, prototype protocol sniffer, tag readers, etc. (compelete).~~
* **Phase 1.** (Current) Set up developing routines for massive contributors activity, architecture and documentation. Building hardware rig for remote testing.
* **Phase 2.** Start massive contributors program. Preparing Developments Kits for sending to few developers.
* **Phase 3.** Next PCB release [Version 1 (F2B0C1)](https://github.com/Flipper-Zero/flipperzero-firmware-community/wiki/Hardware-version-F2B0C1.1) and sending it to more contributos.
* **Phase 4.** Release PCB based on STM32WB55RB and sending it to developers.
* **Phase 5.** Making all repositories publicly open.

# Task for phase 1: (Doing right now)

* Finalize firmware core architecture and document it for contributors onboarding. You can see progress in [Core project](https://github.com/Flipper-Zero/flipperzero-firmware-community/projects/3)
* Set up a test environment and CI. You can see progress in [Environment project](https://github.com/Flipper-Zero/flipperzero-firmware-community/projects/2)
* Create Flipper Zero software emulator with display and buttons [Task #22](https://github.com/Flipper-Zero/flipperzero-firmware-community/issues/22)
* Set up integration between wiki and issues, configure wiki generator from doc files: [Task #16](https://github.com/Flipper-Zero/flipperzero-firmware-community/issues/16)
* Finish the basic wiki pages: create feature description, UI sketches, links to related project/code, documentation for protocols/
* Make basic code examples [Task #15](https://github.com/Flipper-Zero/flipperzero-firmware-community/issues/15)
* Transfer old code to new architecture

**We are open for changes!** You can suggest changes to any part of the code, wiki, guidelines, workflow, automation, etc.

If you are deary to start, pleaseÂ read [contribution guide](https://github.com/Flipper-Zero/flipperzero-firmware-community/wiki/Contributing) about creating issue, editing wiki, improve codebase and configure environment.

# Firmware

**[Firmware page](https://github.com/Flipper-Zero/flipperzero-firmware-community/wiki/Firmware)**

Flipper consists of two main parts:

* Core: OS, HAL, FS, bootloader, FURI
* Applications: features like RFID or Tamagotchi, and also background tasks like button debouncing and control the backlight.

## UI
