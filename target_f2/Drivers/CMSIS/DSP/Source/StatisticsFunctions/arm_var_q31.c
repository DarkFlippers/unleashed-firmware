 * @brief Variance of the elements of a Q31 vector.
 * @param[in]       *pSrc points to the input vector
 * @param[in]       blockSize length of the input vector
 * @param[out]      *pResult variance value returned here
 * @return none.
 * @details
 * <b>Scaling and Overflow Behavior:</b>
 *
 *\par
 * The function is implemented using an internal 64-bit accumulator.
 * The input is represented in 1.31 format, which is then downshifted by 8 bits
 * which yields 1.23, and intermediate multiplication yields a 2.46 format.
 * The accumulator maintains full precision of the intermediate multiplication results,
 * but provides only a 16 guard bits.
 * There is no saturation on intermediate additions.
 * If the accumulator overflows it wraps around and distorts the result.
 * In order to avoid overflows completely the input signal must be scaled down by
 * log2(blockSize)-8 bits, as a total of blockSize additions are performed internally.
 * After division, internal variables should be Q18.46
 * Finally, the 18.46 accumulator is right shifted by 15 bits to yield a 1.31 format value.
