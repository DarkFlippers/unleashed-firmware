/* Each FreeRTOS port has a unique portmacro.h header file.  Originally a
pre-processor definition was used to ensure the pre-processor found the correct
portmacro.h file for the port being used.  That scheme was deprecated in favour
of setting the compiler's include path such that it found the correct
portmacro.h file - removing the need for the constant and allowing the
portmacro.h file to be located anywhere in relation to the port being used.
Purely for reasons of backward compatibility the old method is still valid, but
to make it clear that new projects should not use it, support for the port
specific constants has been moved into the deprecated_definitions.h header
file. */
