# Visual Studio Code workspace for Flipper Zero

## Setup

 * To start developing with VSCode, run `./fbt vscode_dist` in project root. _That should only be done once_
 * After that, open firmware folder in VSCode: "File" > "Open folder"

 For more details on fbt, see [fbt docs](../documentation/fbt.md).


## Workflow

Commands for building firmware are invoked through Build menu: Ctrl+Shift+B.

To attach a debugging session, first build and flash firmware, then choose your debug probe in Debug menu (Ctrl+Shift+D).

Note that you have to detach debugging session before rebuilding and re-flashing firmware.
