/** Check if CPU is in IRQ or kernel running and IRQ is masked
 * 
 * Originally this primitive was born as a workaround for FreeRTOS kernel primitives shenanigans with PRIMASK.
 * 
 * Meaningful use cases are:
 * 
 * - When kernel is started and you want to ensure that you are not in IRQ or IRQ is not masked(like in critical section)
 * - When kernel is not started and you want to make sure that you are not in IRQ mode, ignoring PRIMASK.
 * 
 * As you can see there will be edge case when kernel is not started and PRIMASK is not 0 that may cause some funky behavior.
 * Most likely it will happen after kernel primitives being used, but control not yet passed to kernel.
 * It's up to you to figure out if it is safe for your code or not.
