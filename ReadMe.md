### Welcome to Flipper Zero Unleashed Firmware repo! 
Our goal is to make any features possible in this device without any limitations! 

Please help us implement emulation for all subghz dynamic (rolling code) protocols!

<br>

### This software is for experimental purposes only and is not meant for any illegal activity/purposes. <br> We do not condone illegal activity and strongly encourage keeping transmissions to legal/valid uses allowed by law. <br> Also this software is made without any support from Flipper Devices and in no way related to official devs.

# What's changed
* SubGHz regional TX restrictions removed
* SubGHz frequecy range can be extended in settings file (Warning: It can damage flipper's hardware)
* Many rolling code protocols now have the ability to save & send captured signals
* FAAC SLH (Spa) & BFT Mitto (secure with seed) manual creation
* Sub-GHz static code brute-force plugin
* LFRFID Fuzzer plugin
* Custom community plugins and games added
* Extra SubGHz frequencies + extra Mifare Classic keys
* Picopass/iClass plugin included in releases
* Recompiled IR TV Universal Remote for ALL buttons
* Universal remote for Projectors, Fans, A/Cs and Audio(soundbars, etc.)
* BadUSB keyboard layouts
* Customizable Flipper name
* SubGHz -> Press OK in frequency analyzer to use detected frequency in Read modes
* SubGHz -> Long press OK button in SubGHz Frequency analyzer to switch to Read menu 
* Other small fixes and changes throughout
* See other changes in changelog and in readme below
