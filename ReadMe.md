### Welcome to the Flipper Zero Unleashed Firmware repo! 

#### **This firmware is a fork from** [flipperdevices/flipperzero-firmware](https://github.com/flipperdevices/flipperzero-firmware)

<br>

### Most stable custom firmware focused on new features and improvements of original firmware components, with almost no UI changes

<br>

##### This software is for experimental purposes only and is not meant for any illegal activity/purposes. <br> We do not condone illegal activity and strongly encourage keeping transmissions to legal/valid uses allowed by law. <br> Also, this software is made without any support from Flipper Devices and is in no way related to the official devs.

## Please support development of the project
The majority of this project is developed and maintained by me, @xMasterX.
I'm unemployed, and the only income I receive is from your donations.
Our team is small and the guys are working on this project as much as they can solely based on the enthusiasm they have for this project and the community.
- @assasinfil - SubGHz
- @Svaarich - UI design and animations
- @Amec0e - Infrared assets
- Community moderators in Telegram, Discord, and Reddit
- And of course our GitHub community. Your PRs are a very important part of this firmware and open-source development.

The amount of work done on this project is huge and we need your support, no matter how large or small. Even if you just say, "Thank you Unleashed firmware developers!" somewhere. Doing so will help us continue our work and will help drive us to make the firmware better every time.
Also, regarding our releases, every build has and always will be free and open-source. There will be no paywall releases or closed-source apps within the firmware. As long as I am working on this project it will never happen.
