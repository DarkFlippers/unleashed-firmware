Welcome to Flipper Zero's Custom Firmware repo!
Our goal is to make any features possible in this device without any limitations! 

Please help us implement emulation for all dynamic (rolling codes) protocols and brute-force app!

# Update firmware

## [Get Latest Firmware from GitHub Releases](https://github.com/Eng1n33r/flipperzero-firmware/releases)

<br>
<br>

### **Update to the latest official firmware before proceeding**

<br>
<br>

## With offline update on flipper

### **Replace (CURRENT VERSION) with version that you downloaded from releases**
- Unpack `flipper-z-f7-update-(CURRENT VERSION).tgz` (or `.zip`) into any free folder on your PC or smartphone
- You should find folder named `f7-update-(CURRENT VERSION)` that contains files like `update.fuf`, `resources.tar` and etc..
- Remove microSD card from flipper and insert it into PC or smartphone (you can skip this step and upload all files using qFlipper)
- Create new folder `update` on the root of the microSD card and move folder that you previously extracted from archive - `f7-update-(CURRENT VERSION)` into `update` on microSD card
- So result should look like `update/f7-update-(CURRENT VERSION)/` with all files in this folder on microSD card, remember iOS default Files app doesnt show all files properly (3 instead of 5), so you need to use another app for unpacking or use PC or Android
- Verify that all files are present on your microSD card:
    * `update/f7-update-(CURRENT VERSION)/flipper-z-f7-full-(CURRENT VERSION).dfu`
    * `update/f7-update-(CURRENT VERSION)/flipper-z-f7-updater-(CURRENT VERSION).bin`
    * `update/f7-update-(CURRENT VERSION)/resources.tar`
    * `update/f7-update-(CURRENT VERSION)/stm32wb5x_BLE_Stack_light_fw.bin`
    * `update/f7-update-(CURRENT VERSION)/update.fuf`


- After all you need to insert microSD card back into flipper, navigate into filebrowser, open this file 
`update/f7-update-(CURRENT VERSION)/update.fuf`
- Update will start, wait for all stages, and when flipper started after update, you can upload any custom [IR libs](https://github.com/logickworkshop/Flipper-IRDB), and other stuff using qFlipper or directly into microSD card

<br>
<br>

## With qFlipper

### **Replace (CURRENT VERSION) with version that you downloaded from releases**
- Connect your device and select `Update from file`
then select **`flipper-z-f7-full-(CURRENT VERSION).dfu`**

- And wait, if all flashed successfully - you can manually upload IR libs and other stuff to sd card

- If you doing install for first time or migrating from official fw, unpack 3 folders from archive `sd-card-(CURRENT VERSION).zip` onto your microSD card


<br>
<br>

## With USB DFU 

1. Download latest [Firmware](https://github.com/Eng1n33r/flipperzero-firmware/releases)

2. Reboot Flipper to Bootloader
 - Press and hold `← Left` + `↩ Back` for reset 
 - Release `↩ Back` and keep holding `← Left` until blue LED lights up
 - Release `← Left`

### **Replace (CURRENT VERSION) with version that you downloaded from releases**
3. Run `dfu-util -D flipper-z-f7-full-(CURRENT VERSION).dfu -a 0`

4. If you doing install for first time or migrating from official fw, unpack 3 folders from archive `sd-card-(CURRENT VERSION).zip` to your microSD card

<br>
<br>

# After install:
- ### If you installed using .dfu - unpack 3 folders from archive `sd-card-(CURRENT VERSION).zip` to your microSD card
<br>

# How to Build by yourself:

## Clone the Repository

You should clone with 
```shell
$ git clone --recursive https://github.com/Eng1n33r/flipperzero-firmware.git
```

## Build with Docker

### Prerequisites

1. Install [Docker Engine and Docker Compose](https://www.docker.com/get-started)
2. Prepare the container:

 ```sh
 docker-compose up -d
 ```

### Compile everything for development

```sh
docker-compose exec dev make
```

### Compile everything for release + get updater package to update from microSD card

```sh
docker-compose exec dev make updater_package TARGET=f7 DEBUG=0 COMPACT=1
```

Check `dist/` for build outputs.

Use **`flipper-z-{target}-full-{suffix}.dfu`** to flash your device.

If compilation fails, make sure all submodules are all initialized. Either clone with `--recursive` or use `git submodule update --init --recursive`.

# Build on macOS

## macOS Prerequisites

Make sure you have [brew](https://brew.sh) and install all the dependencies:
```sh
brew bundle --verbose
```

**P.S. Brewfile has been fixed, so build works now**

### Compile everything for development

```sh
make
```

### Compile everything for release + get updater package to update from microSD card

```sh
make updater_package TARGET=f7 DEBUG=0 COMPACT=1
```

Check `dist/` for build outputs.

Use **`flipper-z-{target}-full-{suffix}.dfu`** to flash your device.
